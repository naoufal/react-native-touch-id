React Native Touch ID is a [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) library for authenticating users with biometric authentication methods like Face ID and Touch ID on both iOS and Android (experimental).

Note: the awesome folks over at [Expo](https://expo.io) have begun open-sourcing some of their modules for compatability with React Native projects not built with Expo. As such you can attempt to use their equivalent library called [LocalAuthentication](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v30.0.0/sdk/local-authentication) at [expo-local-authentication](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-local-authentication) if you run into any issues here!

## Install
```shell
npm i --save react-native-touch-id
```
or
```shell
yarn add react-native-touch-id
```

## Support
Due to the rapid changes being made in the React Native ecosystem, we are not officially going to support this module on anything but the latest version of React Native. The current supported version is indicated on the React Native badge at the top of this README.  If it's out of date, we encourage you to submit a pull request!

## Usage
### Linking the Library
In order to use Biometric Authentication, you must first link the library to your project.

#### Using react-native link
Use the built-in command:
```shell
react-native link react-native-touch-id
```

#### Using Cocoapods (iOS only)
On iOS you can also link package by updating your podfile
```ruby
pod 'TouchID', :path => "#{node_modules_path}/react-native-touch-id"
```
and then run
```shell
pod install
```

#### Using native linking
There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).

### Platform Differences

iOS and Android differ slightly in their TouchID authentication.

On Android you can customize the title and color of the pop-up by passing in the **optional config object** with a color and title key to the `authenticate` method. Even if you pass in the config object, iOS **does not** allow you change the color nor the title of the pop-up.

Error handling is also different between the platforms, with iOS currently providing much more descriptive error codes.

### App Permissions

Add the following permissions to their respective files:

In your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />
```

In your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Enabling Face ID allows you quick and secure access to your account.</string>
```

### Requesting Face ID/Touch ID Authentication
Once you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:

```js
var TouchID = require('react-native-touch-id');
```
or
```js
import TouchID from 'react-native-touch-id'
```

Requesting Face ID/Touch ID Authentication is as simple as calling:
```js
TouchID.authenticate('to demo this react-native component', optionalConfigObject)
  .then(success => {
    // Success code
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Failure code
  });
```


## Example
Using Face ID/Touch ID in your app will usually look like this:
```js
import React from "react"
var TouchID = require('react-native-touch-id');
//or import TouchID from 'react-native-touch-id'

class YourComponent extends React.Component {
  _pressHandler() {
    TouchID.authenticate('to demo this react-native component', optionalConfigObject)
      .then(success => {
        AlertIOS.alert('Authenticated Successfully');
      })
      .catch(error => {
        AlertIOS.alert('Authentication Failed');
      });
  },

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        ...
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._pressHandler}>
          <Text>
            Authenticate with Touch ID
          </Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
      </View>
    );
  }
};
```

## Methods
### authenticate(reason, config)
Attempts to authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID.
Returns a `Promise` object.

__Arguments__
- `reason` - **optional** - `String` that provides a clear reason for requesting authentication.

- `config` - **optional** - configuration object for more detailed dialog setup:
  - `title` - **Android** - title of confirmation dialog
  - `color` - **Android** - color of confirmation dialog
  - `fallbackLabel` - **iOS** - by default specified 'Show Password' label. If set to empty string label is invisible.


__Examples__
```js
//config is optional to be passed in on Android
const optionalConfigObject = {
  title: "Authentication Required", // Android
  color: "#e00606", // Android,
  fallbackLabel: "Show Passcode" // iOS (if empty, then label is hidden)
}

TouchID.authenticate('to demo this react-native component', optionalConfigObject)
  .then(success => {
    AlertIOS.alert('Authenticated Successfully');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    AlertIOS.alert('Authentication Failed');
  });
```

### isSupported()
Verify's that Touch ID is supported.
Returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `String` of `FaceID` or `TouchID` .

__Examples__
```js
TouchID.isSupported()
  .then(biometryType => {
    // Success code
    if (biometryType === 'FaceID') {
        console.log('FaceID is supported.');
    } else {
        console.log('TouchID is supported.');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Failure code
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Errors
There are various reasons why biomentric authentication may fail.  When it does fails, `TouchID.authenticate` will return an error code representing the reason.

Below is a list of error codes that can be returned **on iOS**:

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `LAErrorAuthenticationFailed` | Authentication was not successful because the user failed to provide valid credentials. |
| `LAErrorUserCancel` | Authentication was canceled by the user—for example, the user tapped Cancel in the dialog. |
| `LAErrorUserFallback` | Authentication was canceled because the user tapped the fallback button (Enter Password). |
| `LAErrorSystemCancel` | Authentication was canceled by system—for example, if another application came to foreground while the authentication dialog was up. |
| `LAErrorPasscodeNotSet` | Authentication could not start because the passcode is not set on the device. |
| `LAErrorBiometryNotAvailable` | Authentication could not start because Biometry is not available on the device. |
| `LAErrorBiometryNotEnrolled` | Authentication could not start because Biometry has no enrolled biometric identities. |
| `LAErrorBiometryLockout` | Authentication could not start because Biometry had too many failed attempts. |
| `RCTTouchIDUnknownError` | Could not authenticate for an unknown reason. |
| `RCTTouchIDNotSupported` | Device does not support Touch ID. |

_More information on errors can be found in [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/LocalAuthentication/Reference/LAContext_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/LAError)._
